    author:"Ajay",
    content: "This quotation for Faulkner’s 1936 novel comes from the Books of Samuel – more specifically, 19:4 in 2 Samuel, which is in the Old Testament and relates some of the history of Israel. Absalom, the third son of David, rebelled against his father and was killed in battle. The full Biblical sentence is But the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!

The line in question is If I forget thee, Jerusalem, let my right hand forget its skill."

Huxley was a big fan of Shakespeare and quoted him in two more famous book titles, namely Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow (1956) and Mortal Coils (1921), from Macbeth and Hamlet respectively. Both are part of famous soliloquies; Hamlet’s in particular is the ‘to be or not to be’ speech."
